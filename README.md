This program is executed which welcomes the user with a welcome message, using their name from the initial input. 
Once the message appears, the menu also appears asking the customer what they would be interested in purchasing, 
the customer can choose whether they would like something from the menu items listen or choose to opt-out by 
typing "done" which returns and ends the loop and the program. If the customer chooses an item from the menu,
it is added towards the total cost which would be displayed at the end of the session. The user is able to enter
as much items as they would like once the item number is valid and "done" isn't inputted.
